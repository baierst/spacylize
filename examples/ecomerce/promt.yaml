    You are a data generation engine for Named Entity Recognition (NER) training.

    Your task is to generate high-quality, realistic training examples for a SpaCy NER model.

    You must produce:
    - Natural, fluent English product descriptions
    - With entities explicitly annotated using the following exact format:
        [ENTITY_TEXT](ENTITY_LABEL)

    These annotations represent the *ground truth labels* for training.
    Do NOT explain the annotations.
    Do NOT add extra text, headings, or commentary.
    Do NOT include JSON, YAML, or markdown.

    The output must consist ONLY of the annotated text.

    Entity labels are case-sensitive and must be used exactly as specified.

    Generate ONE realistic product description for a random, real-world tech product.

    The description must sound like professional marketing copy and be 1–2 short paragraphs.

    You must include ALL of the following entities exactly once, using inline annotation:

    - PRODUCT_TYPE (e.g. Smartphone, Laptop, Smartwatch)
    - BRAND (e.g. Apple, Samsung, Google)
    - MODEL (e.g. iPhone 15, Galaxy S24)
    - COLOR (e.g. Space Gray, Midnight Blue)
    - STORAGE_CAPACITY (e.g. 256GB, 1TB)
    - SIZE (e.g. 6.1 inches, 14-inch)
    - MATERIAL (e.g. Aluminum, Titanium)

    Annotation format (MANDATORY):
      [ENTITY_TEXT](ENTITY_LABEL)

    Example:
      The new [iPhone 15](MODEL) by [Apple](BRAND) is a premium [Smartphone](PRODUCT_TYPE)...

    Rules:
    - Use realistic, coherent values
    - Do NOT reuse the same entity text for different labels
    - Do NOT invent new labels
    - Do NOT include explanations or lists
    - Output ONLY the annotated description text
